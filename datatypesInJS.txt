* JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

let foo = 42;    // foo is now a number
foo     = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo     = true;  // foo is now a boolean

* Nine data types:
 - Six data types - primitives: 
    -> Undefined,
    -> Boolean,
    -> Number,
    -> String,
    -> BigInt,
    -> Symbol
- null - if object is not inherited then it is null
- object - structural and constructed objects -- example: new Object, new Array, new Map
if global3 is an object,
- console.log(typeof global3) // output: object
- console.log(global3 instanceof Object) // output: true
- console.log(global3 instanceof String) //output: false
